# BookMyTickets

This project is for booking the tickets of a coach of a train. I have  used the Angular for the development of the project. A person can book upto 7 tickets at a time. Total there are 84 seats in a coach. Booking will be done onthe basis of availability in a row such that group of people should not be apart.
